let drop = Drop(title: "Title", subtitle: "Subtitle", duration: 5.0)
```

```swift
let drop = Drop(
    title: "Title",
    subtitle: "Subtitle",
    icon: UIImage(systemName: "star.fill"),
    action: .init {
        print("Drop tapped")
        Drops.hideCurrent()
    },
    position: .bottom,
    duration: 5.0,
    accessibility: "Alert: Title, Subtitle"
)
```

2. Show it:

```

###### SwiftUI

import SwiftUI
import Drops

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Button("Show Drop") {
            Drops.show(drop)
        }
    }
}
```

###### UIKit
```swift
import UIKit
import Drops

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    let drops = Drops(delayBetweenDrops: 1.0)

    func showDrop() {
        drops.show(drop)
    }
}
